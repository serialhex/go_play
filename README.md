# this is the readme

if you're reading this, then good for you.  it's healthy to read readme's.  in fact, the FDA reccomends reading at least 3 readme's a day to prevent brain rot, pancreatic cancer, herpes, geneital warts, AIDS (really, most STD's), and general cases of the dumbasses (you know, when you've done something that might be stupid and feel like a dumbass).  though if you *really* want to be healthy, you should go and read some manuals.  such as this one: [https://gist.github.com/300512][]  

## ok, enough nonsense, what is this really?

this is my little playground for all things go-related.  yes it does have *one* ruby script, which is only a few lines and probably heavily bug-ridden, but it allows me to compile & link files easily & quickly by just specifying a file to compile (and it turns `foo.go` into `foo.8` and the executable `foo`)  

so there, have fun, and don't hurt yourself! :D
